The configurations for reference methods is summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{OSLOM} was tested with several configurations to explore its performance:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{-r 10} for 10 runs to ensure robustness.
        \item \texttt{-fast} for quick execution.
        \item \texttt{-r 10 -hr 0} to limit analysis to the first hierarchical level.
        \item \texttt{-r 5 -hr 0 -t 0.2} with a stricter p-value threshold.
        \item \texttt{-r 5 -hr 0 -cp 0.3} and \texttt{-r 5 -hr 0 -cp 0.7} to test different coverage parameters.
        \item \texttt{-infomap 5 -r 5 -hr 0} integrating Infomap results for initial partitioning.
        \item \texttt{-louvain 5 -r 5 -hr 0} using Louvain method results for initial partitioning.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{IPCA} was applied with threshold values \texttt{tin=[0.5, 0.1, 0.01]} to explore various levels of cluster pruning.

    \item \textbf{ASLPAW} was employed with default settings, without additional parameter tuning.

    \item \textbf{WSBM} was configured to handle both non-overlapping and overlapping communities, with and without degree correction (\texttt{deg\_corr = True/False}), and using both real-normal and real-exponential distribution models.

    \item \textbf{DANMF} was configured with the following settings:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{hidden\_layers\_size}: Various layer sizes such as \texttt{"32", "64", "128", "256", "64, 32", "128, 64", "128,32", "256,128", "256,64"} were tested.
        \item \texttt{output\_layer\_size}: Ranged from 2 to a maximum size, determined by the trial.
        \item \texttt{iterations}: Evaluated with 10, 100, 500, and 1000 iterations.
        \item \texttt{lamb}: Tested with lambda values of 0.1, 1, and 10.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
